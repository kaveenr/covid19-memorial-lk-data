Heads of all media institutions
More positive and responsible media reporting on Covid-19 outbreak.

In news reporting on people who are currently infected with the Covid-19 virus or subject
to quarantine, it has been observed that certain electronic media broadcast illustrations
that harm the privacy of individuals, such as the manner they are taken into quarantine or
hospitalization and their homes or their surroundings. In some cases, patients and
associates are perceived as anti-social by some of the media.

Telecasting of such scenes does not make an effective contribution to the proper awareness
of the people. Some people may not even seek treatment or quarantine because of the risk
of socializing such scenes that harm their privacy. There has been a great deal of public
displeasure and protest against this negative use of the media. This has also disturbed the
special social mission of the media to properly educate the public at this critical juncture.

Accordingly, | kindly request you not to shoot or telecast scenes that could harm the privacy
and social dignity of those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 or their associates
from now on.

In particular, | greatly appreciate the continuous active contribution of all media institutions

in rescuing the society from this menace.
