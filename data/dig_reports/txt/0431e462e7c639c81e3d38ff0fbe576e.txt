Motivating people over 60 years of age to get vaccinated

As you are aware quarantine curfew now in force will be effective till 4.00am Monday, 30 August.

The quarantine curfew has been imposed to restrict the gathering and movement of people to
the maximum extent in order to control the Covid 19 pandemic. Another objective of the
quarantine curfew is to vaccinate every person over the age of 60 against the Covid 19 virus.

It has been confirmed that the vast majority of deaths in the past few days due to Covid infection
are of people over 60 years of age and they have not received even a single dose of the vaccine.
Therefore, the government believes that it is essential to motivate these people to get vaccinated.

We eamestly and respectfully request all media institutions in this time of national distress to
publish the following texts / phrases or similar texts / phrases of your choice that motivate people
over 60 years to get themselves vaccinated against Covid 19 Virus, in your newspaper pages and
to allocate your valuable air time as many times as possible so that the country will be able to
control the pandemic within reasonable time.

Here are some texts / phrases to use as you wish.

> Vaccination is the only way to save lives from the Covid 19 epidemic.

> Everyone over 60 of age will be vaccinated during the coming week. Get registered and get
your vaccine immediately.

> Dial 1906 to get registered.

> The majority of Covid deaths are of those who have not received a single dose of Covid
vaccine.

> We highly appreciate your cooperation in this regard.
