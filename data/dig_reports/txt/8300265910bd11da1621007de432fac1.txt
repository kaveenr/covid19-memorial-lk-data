Ending the grace period to pay overdue traffic spot-fines through Post/ Sub Post Offices

“A grace period was granted for the payment of traffic spot-fines due to the COVID-19 pandemic
and the subsequent travel restrictions in the country. However, steps have been taken to end that
grace period with effect from 2021.11.14. Accordingly, payments for traffic spot-fines imposed
from 2021.10.31 would be accepted without any surcharge until 2021.11.14 and thereafter,
payments for traffic spot-fines until 28 days would be accepted together with a surcharge.

At the same time, payment for traffic offences committed from 2021.11.01 onward would be
worked out on 14 days as usual, and be accepted, and payment for traffic spot-fines until 28 days
would be accepted with a surcharge. However, the general public are informed herewith that the
payment of traffic spot-fines which have been unpaid for a period of 28 days would not be
accepted’.
